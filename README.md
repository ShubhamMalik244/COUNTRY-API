## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with (SASS Perprocessor)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Made Desktop version first
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I went with the structuring process first,
than i styled it and then add Action to it
haven't used any css library Cause i am not a cut, copy, paste kind of guy
not saying it's bad but what i don't use a lot 

i went to it day by day so took a lote of time 
but i like it, took my time 

now to the question what i learned 
haven't learned anyting i didn't know 
but it helped me practice 
though can share one thing that don't get messed up going from 
structure to styling to functionality back and forth 
try to stick to one at a time  

### Continued development

want to come to the same position when i come back from the full detail page 
i made it some how working with scroll but i want it freeze there 

one other thing is when go from one page to other their scrolling get affected by one another 
don't want it happen
